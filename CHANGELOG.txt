- Added new level layouts inspired by my City of the Damned: resedential district, abandoned district, corrupted district.
- Added new enemies inspired by City of the Damned: soldier, machine gunner, scout
- Added hints to effects
- Some usability improvements in the UI screen before each level. Added a hint that explains what you should do on this screen. Added hints to the ability trees. The player can also right-click on the ability to move it to selected abilities list (or remove abilities from there), instead of using drag&drop. When you purchase an ability, it automatically goes to the selected abilities list.
